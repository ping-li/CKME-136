# [CKME 136] Data Analytics: Capstone Project

## Introduction
This is my capstone project for the Data Analytics, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics certificate program at Ryerson University. I chose the topic of cancer detection because I currently work as a research coordinator at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, and I strongly believe that machine learning and data science in general is a very underused asset in the public medical sector. I wanted to combine my education of data science with my domain specific knowledge of cancer research.

## Abstract
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in women. Like many cancers, the likelihood of recurrence is much lower if treated at an earlier stage; thus, earlier diagnosis is key to successful treatment. In this project, the primary objective will be to determine what classification algorithm with perform best when diagnosing breast cancer. Accordingly, the theme of the project will be classification and regression. The dataset used will be the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset<sup>1</sup>, which contain various attributes related to physical measurements of a breast mass, as whether it was diagnosed as a benign or malignant mass (cancerous). The primary objective of this project will be to evaluate various classification algorithms and determine which one is best able to differentiate between benign and malignant breast masses.
